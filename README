This is an experimental FOAF / Linked Data crawler, written using 
the stratified Javascript libraries from http://onilabs.com/apollo
and the RDF utilities from http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2007/tab/

Use at own risk, etc.

Status: it can fetch a bunch of RDF files in pseudo-parallel, and parse / 
process them on arrival. Currently it doesn't do anything with the results
except update an HTML dashboard. 

Ultimately it should support also RDFa, microformats, Turtle etc; for now
the parsing is wired to expect rdf/xml.

See notes in the code for details.
