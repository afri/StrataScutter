FOR THOSE USING THE LIBRARY ON AN EXTERNAL WEB PAGE:

Include rdfwidgets.js and style.css, located in this folder, on your website.  That's it!

FOR THOSE USING THE LIBRARY WITHIN THE TABULATOR EXTENSION:

The widget library is already included in pages where the outline is rendered.  You should be able to access it freely from there for use when developing.
